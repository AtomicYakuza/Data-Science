# ðŸ§  Data Science Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio repository! This collection showcases my hands-on work with various machine learning, data analysis, and visualisation techniques. Each folder contains a focused project with its own dataset, code, and insights.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

This repository includes the following types of projects:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Investigating datasets to discover patterns and relationships.
- **Machine Learning Models** â€“ Building and evaluating supervised and unsupervised models.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** â€“ Handling missing values, feature engineering, and transformation.
- **Visualisation** â€“ Communicating findings through charts, plots, and dashboards.

Each project folder includes:
- Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) or Python scripts (`.py`)
- Data used in the program are located in `Data` folders and contain `.csv` with raw data

## ðŸ“ˆ Featured Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Evaluating KS4 Outcomes** | Analysing the performance of KS4 pupils and the factors influencing their academic results |
